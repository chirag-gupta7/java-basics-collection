# java-basics-collection
This Java code collection demonstrates basic programming concepts. Addition.java aims to sum numbers (currently concatenates strings). Hello.java is a standard "Hello, World!" program. Oddeven.java determines if a user-input number is odd or even. Trianglepattern.java generates an asterisk-based triangle pattern based on user input.
# Java Practice Programs

This repository contains a collection of simple Java programs.

## Programs

*   **[Addition.java](d:/coding/java/patterns/Addition.java)**: A program that performs an addition operation and prints the result.
*   **[Hello.java](d:/coding/java/patterns/Hello.java)**: A classic "Hello, World!" program.
*   **[Oddeven.java](d:/coding/java/patterns/Oddeven.java)**: A program that checks if a given number is odd or even.
*   **[Trianglepattern.java](d:/coding/java/patterns/Trianglepattern.java)**: A program that prints a triangle pattern of asterisks based on user input.

## How to Run

1.  Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
2.  Compile the Java file using `javac`:
    ```sh
    javac <FileName>.java
    ```
3.  Run the compiled class file using `java`:
    ```sh
    java <ClassName>
    ```
    For example, to run `Hello.java`:
    ```sh
    javac Hello.java
    java Hello
    ```
